# DevOps Environment Setup (Ubuntu Host)

This is a step-by-step outline for the environment setup mini-project, which is part of the **first mini-project in Module 1** of the **DevOps learning track** under **3MTT Cohort 3**.


> **Note:** Unlike some setups that require installing Ubuntu inside VirtualBox on Windows, my laptop runs **Ubuntu as the primary operating system**. Therefore, I did not need to install VirtualBox or set up a virtual machine. All tools were installed directly on Ubuntu for better performance and simplicity.
